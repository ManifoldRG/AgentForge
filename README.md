# AgentForge ⚒️

## Vision

The AgentForge project focuses on building general tooling to construct multicapability AI systems by composing skills and models together, and having intelligent processes use those skills/models. An example of the things such tooling would allow you to build is AI assistants that can do multiple tasks and interact intelligently with users. The operative model for this is that of XiaoIce, HuggingGPT or Google Assistant. 

We are explicitly building systems that humans will interact with, with an emphasis slightly more on building composite systems out of state of the art technologies and algorithmic innovation in task selection rather than a purely learned model. 

This is still a work in progress, but if you use this project, we'd love for you to refer back to Manifold in your code!
