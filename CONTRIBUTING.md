## Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. Issues are generally assigned to members of the Core Team, as these issues are used by the core team to track tasks. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to look into it and engage in discourse in the comments on the issue. The core team also uses the comments as documentation for these tasks, so we will directly interact with these issue comments.

You can also speak with us about contributions, or about anything else, in the Discord server. We are an active community and the core team engages with the Discord server every day.

As a final note, please be respectful when commenting on these issues as they are publicly viewable. Thank you!
