This project is just starting out, which means we're in the middle of literature review and investigation. Check it out, our issues are public and viewable, and you can see what we're doing in real time. Unfortunately, this means that we haven't yet reached the point of having scoped out tasks for the community to tackle. Stay tuned as we build those out!
